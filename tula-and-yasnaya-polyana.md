Tula is a city rich in history and traditions, with samovars and gingerbread as its beloved symbols—integral parts of Russian culture. 

Here, you can immerse yourself in the local art of tea drinking and savor the famous Tula gingerbread. 

Nearby lies Yasnaya Polyana, the estate of Leo Tolstoy, one of the world’s greatest writers, whose works profoundly influenced 20th-century Western literature. 

A stroll through the avenues of his estate and a tour of the house-museum transport you to the very atmosphere where his masterpieces were created, revealing a unique world of Russian culture and thought.
