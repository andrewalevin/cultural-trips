Recommendations and Important Tips for the Trip to Yasnaya Polyana and Tula

🌧️ For a stroll through Tolstoy’s estate, especially in November weather, it’s important to be prepared for changing conditions. The paths in the park leading to the historic sites can be damp and slippery. We recommend bringing waterproof shoes 👞 and an umbrella—just in case it rains! ☔


![telegram-cloud-photo-size-2-5264844828280219294-y](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5399217b-141e-491d-a5a8-83e80e215b8a)

Transportation and Schedule

🚄 You can reach Tula on the comfortable high-speed train “Lastochka,” which runs transit and is perfect for day trips. 

The travel time is 2 hours and 30 minutes, with the train departing from Moscow at 08:46 and arriving at 11:16, and returning at 20:21, arriving back at 22:53. This schedule allows you to see everything and return on the same day. 😎


Since this train is popular among residents of neighboring regions who often travel to Moscow for work, evening tickets can sell out quickly. The best day to travel is Sunday, when the morning train is usually less crowded. A ticket for the “Lastochka” costs about 700 rubles, which is comparable to a regular train, but the travel time is significantly shorter. 🚂💨

If tickets for your desired route are sold out, the transportation company allows you to purchase tickets from a more distant point, such as the city of Kursk, with a small surcharge (around 1200 rubles). It’s also important to consider that it’s advisable to buy “Lastochka” tickets in advance. 🎟️

Planning and Ticket Refunds

The transportation company offers convenient ticket refund conditions—you can return your tickets with a full refund even up to 8 hours before the train departs. This is an amazing opportunity that has remained since the days of Soviet railroads. 🛤️

Thus, there’s no need to commit to a specific weekend right away. It’s better to book several tickets in advance, for example, for two consecutive weekends. This will give you the flexibility to choose the most suitable day for your trip depending on the weather conditions. 🌞

✨ I have visited Tula several times, exploring all its captivating attractions. A couple of years ago, I embarked on a journey almost following this same plan on the comfortable “Lastochka.” 🚄 Considering this experience, I have crafted an exciting itinerary that will allow you to discover the best places in Tula in just one day and enjoy unforgettable impressions! 🌟
